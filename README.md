Abstract: *3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient explicit representation for real-time novel view synthesis. However, repeated densification during training often leads to uncontrolled Gaussian growth, causing heavy memory overhead and slow convergence. This redundancy stems from two limitations: (1) fixed opacity thresholds that fail to adapt to evolving distributions; (2) irreversible pruning strategies that risk eliminating essential Gaussians. 
To address this, we propose *Adaptive and Recoverable Gaussian Pruning (ARGP)*, a training-integrated framework that suppresses redundant growth while preserving reconstruction quality. During densification, we employ *Adaptive Opacity Pruning (AOP)*, which removes a fixed proportion of low-opacity Gaussians based on quantiles, effectively suppressing redundancy. In the fine-tuning stage, we introduce *Iterative Recovery Pruning (IRP)*, which selectively reinstates critical Gaussians using a gradient-informed recovery score, thus preventing over-pruning and preserving reconstruction quality. 
Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending validate the effectiveness our proposed ARGP. For instance, ARGP achieves an 85.4% reduction in Gaussian counts and 1.60Ã— training speedup, while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality on Tanks & Temples.*
